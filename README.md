# Recursive-Rebels-3D-World

## Program Projective
Create an original scene in Minecraft fashion. It is simple but can be used to demonstrate different aspects of graphics like texture mapping, lighting, visible surface detection, surface rendering etc. We will be unable to cover some of the more advanced concepts in this course but learning to implement them using OpenGL through our LWJG Library is very simple. Hence, this project forces you to explore features of the LWJGL.
